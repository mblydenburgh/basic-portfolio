        <p>Hello! I'm Mike and this is a small corner of the web where I can show a little about myself and showcase my development as a...developer! I am a graduate of UMass Lowell's Chemical Engineering program and have had an opportunity to work in a variety of settings from bio-tech manufacturing to natural gas design to toothpaste making. As such, solving open ended problems and learning are where I feel at home. I have always had a interest in coding and have decided to take my hobby to the next level and change career paths!</p>

        <p>Outside of my professional life I love live music, traveling, cooking, hiking, science, and finding some good microbrews to try. Some of my favorite trips were travel to see Umphrey's McGee shows, I have seen them 50 times in 11 different states and always enjoy exploring the local spots and meeting people along the way. I play guitar, attempt to play the drums, and enjoy the occasional strategy or role playing game when not out and about. I am also a weirdo and enjoy learning about various physics and math topics, from special relativity and quantum physics, to different types of infinity, to the physics of the cereal bowl (seriously, check it out!)</p>

        <p>I have three wonderful ladies in my life- Jackie, Layla, and Sadie. We are a happy 12 legged family and live in Rochester, NH!</p>
